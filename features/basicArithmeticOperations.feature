Feature: Basic Arithmetic Operations

  Background:
    Given the calculator app is open

  Scenario Outline: Perform basic arithmetic operation - <operation>
    When the user taps "<firstNumber>"
    And the user taps "<operator>"
    And the user taps "<secondNumber>"
    And the user taps "="
    Then the result is "<result>"

    Examples:
      | operation      | firstNumber | operator | secondNumber | result |
      | Addition       | 5           | +        | 3            | 8      |
      | Subtraction    | 9           | -        | 6            | 3      |
      | Multiplication | 4           | ร        | 2            | 8      |
      | Division       | 10          | รท        | 2            | 5      |

  Scenario: Division by zero
    # This step reuses the same definition as in the basic arithmetic outline
    When the user taps "8"
    And the user taps "รท"
    And the user taps "0"
    And the user taps "="
    Then the result is "Undefined"
